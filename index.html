  <p>Hello, my name is Mike Anthony Lavarientos! I am 16 years old from Mangaldan, Pangasinan. I've dreamed of going to japan to see and learn about their culture and nature! and I want to eat a food like the japanese food and, I want to learn how to make the food there then I want to live in japan and help my future wife to make a family.
